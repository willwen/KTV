What makes me cry, is not only last night's wine
What makes me lingering, is more than your tender
How far away still to go? You clasped my hand
What makes me stumped, is the struggling freedom

Separation is always in September, memory is sorrowful thought
The green weeping willows in deep autumn, is kissing my forehead.
In this small rainy city, I never forget you
Chengdu, I took everything away from here, except you

Go for a walk with me through streets in Chengdu
Until all the lights were turned out, we would still go on
You would be hold in my arm, I would put my hand into pant pocket
Walk till the end of Yulin Road, sit in front of the pub

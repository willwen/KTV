Shawty snap (yeah) T-pain
Damn, shawty snap, Yung joc (shawty)
Hey, hey she's snappin'
Snap ya fingers, do the step, you can do it all by yourself
Woo, baby girl, what's your name?
Let me talk to you, let me buy you a drink
I'm T-pain, you know me
Konvict music nappy boy ooh
I know the club close at three
What's the chances that you are rollin' wit' me?
Back to the crib, show you how I live
Let's get drunk, forget what we did
I'm a buy you a drank (Then I'm a take you home with me)
I got money in the bank (Shawty, what chu think about that? Find me in the gray Cadillac)
We in the bed like (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We in the bed like (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Talk to me, I talk back
Let's talk money, I'll talk that
Krunk juice bombs, Oakley shades
Shawty got class, oh behave
Let's get gone, walk it out (walk it out)
Just like that; that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
We gon' have fun, you gon' see
On that Patron, you should get like me
I'm a buy you a drank (Then I'm a take you home with me)
I got money in the bank (Shawty, what chu think about that? Find me in the gray Cadillac)
We in the bed like (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We in the bed like (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Won't you meet me at the bar? Respect big pimpin'
Tell me how you feel, mama, tell me what you sippin'
A certified dime piece deserves Lou-ey one-three
One-fifty a shot, three for you and three for me
I'm checkin' yo' body language; I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips, I get a tinglin' sensation
Now we're both 'bout tipsy, you say you in the mood
All I need is 'bout a hour, better yet, maybe two (two)
Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in ya ear, ya legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
I'm a let T-pain sing it so he can make it clear
I'm a buy you a drank (Then I'm a take you home with me)
I got money in the bank (Shawty, what chu think about that? Find me in the gray Cadillac)
We in the bed like (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We in the bed like (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Let's get gone, walk it out (Now walk it out, think about it, ah, snap)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo' self
Let's get gone, walk it out (Now walk it out, think about it, ah, snap)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo' self
I'm a buy you a drank (Then I'm a take you home with me)
I got money in the bank (Shawty, what chu think about that? Find me in the gray Cadillac)
We in the bed like (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We in the bed like (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
